Database creation and accessing for final project
Project involved creating a database based on following description:
"Suppose that you are contacted by the owner of a big piano chain called Duluth Great
Pianos to ask you to build a database for him. After your meeting with this person, you
were able to obtain the following requirements: The store keeps track of the id, name, and
email of each client. The store sells digital or acoustic pianos, the latter being either up-
rights or grand pianos. Each piano is identified by a serial number and has a make, model,
year, and MSRP. Every time that a customer buys a piano, the store tracks the receipt id,
the date of the purchase, the amount paid for the instrument, and the name of the salesper-
son. The store keeps track of the dates on which pianos are tuned and regulated, along with
the name of the tuner. When the store sells a piano, it sometimes accepts a trade-in instru-
ment as part of the deal. In such a case, the store keeps track of all piano attributes above
mentioned."

Project also involved accessing the database using java to perform the following actions:
"The owner of the chain wants to perform the following queries on the database:
1. Sell a piano to an existing customer (frequency of the query 30 times/day).
2. Find all pianos of a given make and model: (300 times/day)."
